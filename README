This is gavl, a common support library for other packages of the gmerlin project.

Read the file INSTALL for detailed installation instructions.

The original purpose was to provide datastructures and routines for handling
uncompressed audio- and video data. Over the years it became a central
repository for code, which is shared by the gmerlin package and the
gmerlin-avdecoder library. It's main purpose is to make the gmerlin-avdecoder
library independent from the (huge) gmerlin package.

In the future, more stuff might get moved from libgmerlin to libgavl.

Below is (probably incomplete) list of contained modules:

- Handling of uncompressed audio and video data (gavl.h)

- Handling of compressed audio and video data (compression.h)

- Handling of A/V data stored in special ways for hardware accelleration (hw*.h)

- Connectors (source and sink) for compressed and uncompressed A/V data. They
  usually work in zero-copy mode but can also do implicit A/V conversions when
  necessary (connectors.h)
  
- Polymorphic data containers with high-level types like arrays and dictionaries.
  These are used throughout the whole gmerlin project for non A/V data like
  metadata or configuration data (value.h).
  Libgmerlin contains serialisations for xml and json so complex data structures
  can be saved to or loaded from files in one function call.
      
- Generic socket support code (gavlsocket.h)

- An http-client with support for:
  * Non-blocking I/O for background downloading without a separate thread
  * Redirection
  * https (via gnutls)
  * Seeking
  (httpclient.h)

- An experimental A/V container format for internal usage, currently unused and
  probably not functional (gavf/gavf.h)

- A message structure used throughout the whole gmerlin project for
  communication, both inside the applications and between them.
  libgmerlin contains a serialization for json and a message queue for robust
  inter-thread communication.

- Logging support (log.h)

- Lots of utility functios (util.h)
